# What it is
This is a client library for [etcd](https://etcd.io). The library currently support the version 3 of the API.

**NOTE**: This library is still in development, and it is likely that it will not support the whole API for a while.

# Why
I did not find any decent implementation of this API for C++. The libraries I found that support V3 tend to add too much dependencies apart from what is only necessary (gRPC).

# Building
TODO
